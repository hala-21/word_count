At dawn, the samurai Takeda Jirō knelt before his armor, not to pray for victory, but for clarity. His lord had ordered him to suppress a village uprising—peasants starving after a failed harvest. Jirō rode out knowing the code of bushidō demanded loyalty, yet justice demanded restraint. When he arrived, he saw no rebels—only farmers guarding grain they needed to survive.

Jirō chose a third path. He returned to his lord and spoke plainly, risking disgrace: the order would break the land and stain the clan. The lord relented, quietly. No battle followed. Jirō removed his armor that night, understanding that honor is not proven by the sword alone, but by when you refuse to draw it.
